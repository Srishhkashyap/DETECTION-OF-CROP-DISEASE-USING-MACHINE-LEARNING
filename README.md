# DETECTION-OF-CROP-DISEASE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

Deep Learning techniques are inspired by the architecture of neurons present in the human
brain (Haykin, 1998). These techniques use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and its other
variants, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) to identify the hidden structures in data. There are two prominent advantages of
Deep Learning techniques over the Machine Learning techniques. First, they automatically
extract various features from raw data, and hence there is no need for an extra feature
extraction module. Second, Deep Learning techniques reduce the amount of time required to
process large datasets of high dimensions. Therefore, the Deep Learning techniques are used
to build the proposed hybrid model

Dataset used here is the New Plant Diseases Dataset Dataset . It is an open-source
dataset which consists of about 20,600 images of plant leaf. Three different species of plant
leaves are used for this research process such as Tomato, Potato and Pepper. This disease
detection is done by using both healthy and infected leaves. Nearly 12 diseases for 3 species
of plant leaves are included in this dataset along with their respective healthy leaves. The
original size of the leaf images in the dataset are 256x256. It will be segmented and resized
further for processing of data.
